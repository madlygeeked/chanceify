## It turns into Winamp

Load a classic `.wsz` skin from the
[Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org). The mini player includes
animated sound displays, an equalizer to adjust your sound, and a playlist.
Roll it up into a thin bar or enlarge it while keeping the classic pixels
sharp. [See the mini player in detail](/winamp/).

</div>

## MilkDrop with more than 10,000 presets

On first use, Spotifast automatically downloads the original MilkDrop 2
presets and projectM's Cream of the Crop collection. These visual designs
react to music playing on your computer, in a resizable window or full screen.
[See the controls and preset details](/milkdrop/).

## WhatsApp, just as fast

**Want WhatsApp just as fast and native?** [ZapFast](https://zapfast.rocks) is
Spotifast's sibling: the same native interface, for WhatsApp. Both are built on [fastframe](https://github.com/crmne/fastframe), the shared
foundation for native Rust apps built with egui.

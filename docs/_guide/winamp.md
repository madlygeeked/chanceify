description: Use classic Winamp 2 skins with an analyser, equalizer, and playlist.

Open the mini player with Ctrl+M (Cmd+Shift+M on macOS), the shrink button, or
**Switch to it** in Settings. It supports classic Winamp 2 `.wsz` skins. Find
skins at the [Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org).

Only one player window is open at a time. Click the skin logo or Eject, or use
the shortcut again, to return to the main window.

## Skins and window size

Drop a `.wsz` file on either window to install and use it. Settings lists the
installed skins and can open the skins folder. On Wayland, dropping files on
the window is not available yet: put the `.wsz` file in the skins folder
instead.

Choose **Random**, first in that list, to get a different skin each time you
switch to the mini player, never the same one twice in a row. Settings says
which skin it picked, and choosing a skin yourself turns Random off.

You can also use an unpacked skin folder. Spotifast finds skin files inside
its subfolders, up to eight folders deep, so you do not need to move them all
into one folder.

Right-click the title bar, or click **O**, to choose a size from 1x to 4x.
Each size keeps the classic pixels sharp. The same menu can keep the player
above other windows. **D** toggles double size and **A** toggles always-on-top.
Spotifast remembers the window position where your desktop allows it.

Skins can have transparent areas and shapes other than rectangles. Modern
Winamp 3 and 5 skin formats are not supported; choose classic Winamp 2 skins.

## Main controls

Most controls match Winamp. These work differently:

- **Stop** pauses and rewinds.
- **I** opens the playing album in the main window.
- Repeat is either on or off.
- The X button and both logos return to the main window.

Click the time to switch between elapsed and remaining time. The balance and
MONO/STEREO controls affect playback on this computer. Quit from the
right-click menu or with Ctrl+Q.

The shade button, or a double-click on the title bar, rolls the player up. The
playlist and equalizer have their own shade buttons.

Switching to the main window and back keeps the shade modes and restores the
mini player's own position. It does not inherit the main window's fullscreen
or maximized state. On Linux desktops using Wayland, the desktop chooses where
windows appear and may ignore the saved position.

The left display shows bars that react to the sound (a spectrum analyser).
Click it to switch to a moving sound wave (an oscilloscope), then off.
You can also use the **V** menu. Changes to the equalizer affect the picture;
turning down the volume does not, even at zero. The display reacts only to
music playing on this computer.

## Playlist

**PL** opens the playlist below the player. It shows the playing song followed
by the queue. Double-click a song to play it, Ctrl-click to select several, and
drag the lower-right corner to resize the window. Use X or **PL** to close it.

- **ADD** opens search or Liked Songs.
- **SEL** selects rows.
- **MISC** opens song, artist, and album pages.
- **LIST OPTS** starts one of your playlists or saves the queue as a new one.
- **REM → Remove all** clears your queued songs when this computer is playing.

Spotify does not let third-party apps remove one song from the queue. Notices
from the main window scroll through the mini player's text display.

## Equalizer

**EQ** opens the ten-band equalizer. It affects playback on this computer, not
other Spotify Connect devices. The preamp ranges from -12 to 12 dB. **AUTO**
resets all bands. The same controls and presets are in Settings.
